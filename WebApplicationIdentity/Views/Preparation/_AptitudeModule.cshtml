                <h3>Important Formulas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Profit and Loss:</strong> Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple Interest (SI):</strong> SI = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100</li>
                    <li><strong>Compound Interest (CI):</strong> CI = Principal × ((1 + Rate/100)^Time - 1)</li>
                    <li><strong>Permutations:</strong> nPr = n! / (n - r)!</li>
                    <li><strong>Combinations:</strong> nCr = n! / (r! × (n - r)!)</li>
                    <li><strong>Time, Distance, Speed:</strong> Speed = Distance / Time</li>
                    <li><strong>Time and Work:</strong> Work = Rate × Time</li>
                    <li><strong>Directions:</strong> Clockwise: East → South → West → North → East; Anti-Clockwise: East → North → West → South → East</li>

                <h3>Tricks and Shortcuts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Coding-Decoding:</strong> Look for patterns and common sequences in the given codes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Profit and Loss:</strong> Remember the shortcut: Profit% = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time, Distance, Speed:</strong> Use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Permutations and Combinations:</strong> For small values of n and r, calculate directly; otherwise, use factorial formulas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Directions:</strong> Remember the basic directions and their order to solve quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple Interest and Compound Interest:</strong> Utilize direct formulas for quick calculations.</li>
